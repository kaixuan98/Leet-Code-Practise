### Purpose of this repo
This is a repo that summarise my solution and understand of each leet code question that I attemped.

The sequences and section of questions was given using the [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?weeks=8) tool. I had set to work on the question for 8 hours for 8 weeks. The total questions are 75 and they are the essential questions for a tech interview. 

I will try each question for 3 attempts. The first attempt will be at the decided week, and the rest of the attempts will depends on the time I have throughout the week. 

To implement space repetition on the question to better understand the pattern: 
The gap between Attempt 1 and 2: 1 week
The gap between Attempt 2 and 3: 2 weeks

While practise in different attempt I will try to undertsand the pattern of each questions and try to explain the solution as if I am in an interview. 

Let the fun begin!
